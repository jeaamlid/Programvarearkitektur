Your goal is to fly for as long as possible. Press and hold the screen to make the angel move towards your finger. Change direction by moving your finger 
You get points for airtime. Avoid the balloons and the other flying obstacles. Try to collect coins; they are worth 20p.

You can play either single- or multiplayer games!
In a multiplayer game, write the same room number as your opponent. Remember to give yourself a name. Gather most points and avoid the obstacles longer than your opponent.
